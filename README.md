Electronic diaphragm dosing pumps, also known as solenoid pumps are controlled electronically by a PCB and are solenoid driven. These pumps are used to dispense or inject a precise amount of fluid into a process. They are most commonly used in water treatment applications such as in cooling towers, boilers, and industrial wastewater treatment. <br>

Electronic dosing pumps are usually made from plastic, thermoplastic, or stainless steel and are attached to an electronic controller that enables the fluid flow to be monitored and adjusted easily. Among the various types of dosing pumps, electronic dosing pumps are preferred in many industries, especially for chemical feed applications due to their cost-effectiveness, ease of use, reliability, and high degree of accuracy. They are the core part of integrated metering systems and are designed for automatic chemical dispersion. <br>

Electronic Dosing Pumps use expansion and contraction chambers to move the fluid. They can pump a variety of liquids including corrosives, acids, and bases as well as viscous liquids and slurries. <br>

How does a dosing pump work? <br>
Depending on the brand and model, a dosing pump functions in different ways. All these methods involve drawing a certain amount of liquid and injecting the chemical into the tank or pipe containing the fluid being metered. An electronic dosing pump is powered by an electric motor or air actuator and has a controller that turns the pump on and off while managing the flow rate as well. <br>

Electronic dosing pumps are positive displacement pumps that use a reciprocating diaphragm to move the fluid. Since these pumps do not have any internal parts that can rub against each other to create friction and cause wear, they are quite reliable and have a long life. In addition to this, they also do not require seals or lubrication in the pump head, which also negates the possibility of oil vapor contamination or leakage of the pumped medium. <br>

The key parts of electronic dosing pumps in India are a diaphragm, two valves, a displacement chamber, and a drive mechanism. The diaphragm is a flexible diaphragm that vibrates to create suction to move the fluid in and out of the pump chamber. It is located between the discharge chamber and the connection flange. The two valves operate by allowing fluid to move in and out of the chamber. They are usually baffle vales or spring-loaded ball valves made of the same material as the diaphragm. <br>

When a dosing pump is primed, that is, all the air is pushed out of the lines up to the injector, then it is set for the required dose rate or set to work from its input signal. Once it starts operating, the pump works at its required flow rate until a stop signal pauses the action. <br>

An electronic dosing pump is designed to be reliable so once it is set up properly, it does not require a lot of input except in emergency situations. If there is a product level problem or any other problem, an alarm activates to warn the operator. If the product runs out, the system may also shut down to avoid untreated water or liquid seeping into the treated fluid. <br>

How to set up a dosing pump? <br>
Since the components of a dosing system are very important, their setup is critical to its overall performance. The first thing to ensure is that all the components are compatible with the product being dosed and the feed stream. Fluids that are highly corrosive, have high pressure or high temperature needs specialized parts so that the dosing system does not melt, burst, or corrode. The best electronic dosing pump manufacturers in India provide their clients with consultancy services to determine what kind of electronic dosing pump would suit their needs the best. <br>

Once you determine that everything is compatible, the next step is deciding an appropriate dosing point. There are two things that must be taken into consideration while determining this, the point should be located where the product mixes well and does not affect any other pipe parts. For example, if it is placed before a valve or water meter then these parts could prematurely corrode, not read properly or have a build-up of scale or sludge. <br>

After the selection of a dosing point, the pump needs to be properly located. The ideal point is next to power or compressed air to make it work which is generally next to or below the dosing point to prevent siphoning and protect the water from dust, sun, or heat damage. Even though a dosing pump can handle extremely corrosive products, it is not weather resistant and their casing has a low IP rating so they need to be protected in a cabinet or housing to maximize working life. <br>

Another factor that needs to be taken into consideration is the product container. This depends on the product being dosed, the quantity being dosed, and how much needs to be stored at the pump. If the pump is to be placed in a location that is hard to access or is going to be left for long periods of time, then a large amount of product needs to be stored. For this, a bulk tank or an IBC container can be used. <br>

If all these things are taken into consideration, then the system should work efficiently and safely. One of the crucial things with dosing systems is that you cannot cut corners with it as it can affect the efficiency of the whole system and the cost, safety and output will be compromised. <br>

In this article, the working and installation of electronic dosing pumps are discussed. When you purchase electronic dosing pumps in India, it is crucial to select the right pump for your process. <a href="https://arvindkaigo.com/electronic-dosing-pumps.php">Electronic dosing pump manufacturers in India</a> help in selecting the ideal pump for your process, maintain or overhaul the pump, and are always ready in case of emergencies to guarantee the continuity and smooth functioning of your process. <br>
